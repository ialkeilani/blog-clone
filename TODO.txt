TASKS:
- make app name dynamic in template files (pass it in a context dict as "APP_NAME")
- dynamic app name in views
    - trying removing the call to the ".as_posix()"
- try to access "post_update/delete" views using url bar w/o being authenticated. it should work..if so, add the "mixin" to prevent this

Qs:
- figure out the DTL variable name "post", how does it come through the the DetailView? read more on the DetailView django documentation
