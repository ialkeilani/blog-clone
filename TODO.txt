TASKS:
- make app name dynamic in template files (pass it in a context dict as "APP_NAME")
- dynamic app name in views
    - trying removing the call to the ".as_posix()"
- try to access "post_update/delete" views using url bar w/o being authenticated. it should work..if so, add the "mixin" to prevent this
- try meta ordering on your post model
    class Meta:
        ordering = ["-<fieldname>"]
- try using only get_queryset in PostList view and remove attribute "model"
- simplify return of get_queryset in PostList view to
    return PostList.model.objects.order_by("-published_date")
- code "login_url" of "Post<Create/Update>" class view to dynamically track the login url with the get parameter "next=post/<create/update>"

Qs:
- figure out the DTL variable name "post", how does it come through the the DetailView? read more on the DetailView django documentation
